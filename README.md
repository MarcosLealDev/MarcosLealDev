### Hello there 👋

##My name is Marcos Leal and I'm a Electrical Engineer. 😜

- 🔭 I’m currently working professionally with Fire System Detection and automation with PLCs.
- 🌱 One of my passions is learning about Cloud. GCP and terraform are my prefered options.
- 👯 I’m also programming with Javascript, REACTJS, NEXTJS, REACT NATIVE for fun. Really 😀
- ⚡ Fun fact: There are almost no movies about Electrical Engineers. Maybe none 😐
